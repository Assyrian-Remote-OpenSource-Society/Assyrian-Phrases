The man is the worker. The woman is the builder. (1)
Comes from the times when men had to go to lands far from home to conduct business or work. And the man would send money back home, where his wife would manage the household. The woman would make purchases as necessary for the needs and advancement of the family. So the men were the workers and the women were the builders.
Man is worker. Woman is builder.
